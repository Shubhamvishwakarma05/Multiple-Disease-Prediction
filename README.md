There is a Project of Multiple Disease Prediction Model:-

Multiple Disease Prediction Model

Developed a machine learning model to predict diseases based on patient symptoms, using 20+ parameters with an accuracy of over 90%.

Created a user-friendly interface using Streamlit, allowing seamless interaction for both medical professionals and the general public.

Deployed the model on a public server via Render, making it accessible to users with a public URL for real-time disease prediction.

Enabled more efficient diagnosis by streamlining the symptom-to-disease prediction process, improving healthcare accessibility.
